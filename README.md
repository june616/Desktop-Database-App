# Desktop-Database-App

Created a desktop database application for book store using python that can search for particular book, insert new books data and even update and delete the books data.

The backend part is designed by using SQLite3 library to interact with SQLite database. 

The frontend is built upon Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is designed by using Tkinter library. The frontend part has been connected to the backend part so that the frontend script can be able to fetch and access data from the backend script. 

Apart from that I have also created an executable file so that anyone can access the program without having been installed Python in their computer.
